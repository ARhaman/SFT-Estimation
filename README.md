# SFT-Estimation
The data sets for this study were gathered from recently published literature and are authentic geothermal well data sets. Python and Matlab programming languages were utilized to execute the used models.source (Gul et al., 2019).
Two wells are availables Well-1 and Well-2.
Each well trained and tested by four models are ANN, KNN, RF and FL.
ANN, KNN, RF models trained and tested by Python (Spyder) so, two types of file formats available are .ipynb and .py. for ANN, KNN, RF models.Each model has spilt file which must be run first.
FL model trained and tested by Matlab.So, Matlab file formats available.
Each model forder has word file called 'Results' which refer to the best results with best parametrs that we got during our work.
